# Map Takeaways

## Foreward
This post takes the framework of *A Map of the Universe* (Berger & Rayl 2022) and attempts to distill the findings from that paper into a set of main takeaways. The goal of this exercise is twofold. 1) Create a list of important findings that may be easily referenced without having to dive into the minutiae of the paper. 2) Provide a set of actionable insights that are grounded in a rigorous philosophic framework.

Why does this matter? For one, philosophy and metaphysics is complicated and lends itself well to running in intellectual circles. While this is precisely one of the problems that we address in *A Map of the Universe*, one still finds themself thinking, "what exactly is my stance on that exactly?" after being prompted with some banal question such as, "what is the meaning of life?". By compiling a list of main takeaways from the philosophical framework introduced in the Map, this post will serve as a cheatsheet to sounding cool (and remaining intellectually honest) at a party (and yes, the party will likely be fairly small). Second, for all that we hold dear about Philosophy and Metaphysics, one issue that these domains face is that they are rarely actionable (just look at the post-structuralists, I think they are still complaining about language). In a perfect world, all of our actions are motivated by a rigorous and thoroughly debated philosophy. While this is rarely the case, this post attempts to turn some of the insights from *A Map of the Universe* into actionable insights.

In short, this is a compression exercise. Just as all of human existence is an exercise in compression.




What is the meaning of life? Wrong question.
