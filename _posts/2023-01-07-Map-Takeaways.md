# Map Reflections

#### Foreward
This post takes the framework of [*A Map of the Universe*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4077540) (Berger & Rayl 2022) and attempts to distill the findings from that paper into a set of main reflections. The goal of this exercise is twofold. 1) Create a list of important findings that may be easily referenced without having to dive into the minutiae of the paper. 2) Provide a set of actionable insights that are grounded in a rigorous philosophic framework.

Why does this matter? For one, philosophy and metaphysics is complicated and lends itself well to running in intellectual circles.[^1] While this is precisely one of the problems that we address in *A Map of the Universe*, one still finds themself thinking, "what is my stance on that exactly?" after being prompted with some banal question such as, "what is the meaning of life?". By compiling a list of main takeaways from the philosophical framework introduced in the Map, this post will serve as a cheatsheet to sounding cool (and remaining intellectually honest) at a party (and yes, the party will likely be fairly small). Second, for all that we hold dear about philosophy and metaphysics, one issue that these domains face is that they are rarely actionable (just look at the post-structuralists). In a perfect world, all of our actions are motivated by a rigorous and thoroughly debated philosophy. While this is rarely the case, this post attempts to turn some of the insights from *A Map of the Universe* into actionable insights.

If any of the statements that follow feel bold and unfounded, one may refer to the full text of *A Map of the Universe* for rigorous proofs. If it is not immediately obvious where these foundational statements are placed, one may consider the usage the word
"necessarily" to be a signal for a bold statement that will be a fundamental to the coming takeaway and for which there is a proof in the map. It is also worth pointing out that this piece does not have contain arguments or references to anything other than *A Map of the Universe*. I do not attempt to prove my takeaways nor convince anyone. I merely hope to think through the implications of what I have already posited and clarify things for myself and those who have the same insights as me.

In short, this is a compression exercise. Just as all of human existence is a compression exercise. Reflections on the Map are as follows:

- The Universe is necessarily meaningless. "Meaning" is human specific and should
be pursued in accordance with one's Global Aesthetics.
- The Universe is deterministic, but one is free to comport themselves towards this reality as they wish.
- We cannot know objective truths, in light of this one should judge, pass objective judgment, nor impart one's will upon another.
- Language fails us. Act, do not speak.
- In the equilibrium, knowledge, wisdom, and words go to zero.

#### What is the meaning of life? Wrong question.
At the highest level (Reality), there is no meaning of life, just the Universe. As an observer of the Universe, one cannot cannot "understand" (perceive) the Universe without necessarily compressing it via language. Language introduces inaccuracies and with it goes any hope of knowing the meaning of life or the Universe. We necessarily cannot know the meaning of life. On a human level, the meaning of life is simply a function of the Global Aesthetics (the preferred perceptive states) chosen by a given human and is necessarily different for each person. With this in mind, one should think very hard about their Global Aesthetics and pursue that which is meaningful with respect to their Global Aesthetics. 

As an aside, it is noteworthy emergent phenomenon that among many members of our species posit that the meaning of life is to, "try and figure it out, try and understand the Universe." Though I would be remiss to doubt the many incredible human minds who have posited this answer, it would be sacrilegious to claim that this is the objective meaning of life. However, it is interesting nonetheless to speculate as to why so many "smart" humans converge on this answer.

#### Comportment toward determinism.
"What's happened, happened, which is an expression of faith in the mechanics of the Universe."

The Universe is discrete and finite, thus is it necessarily deterministic. Given this Reality, how should a human comport themselves towards this determinism? As is the curse of metaphysics as a discipline for informing action, theory can only take you so far. Following the pattern of many of the takeaways in this piece, there are a set of higher level Truths about the Universe such as the fact that it is deterministic, but within the domain space defined by these Truths we are left helpless to do as we please. If you choose to internalize that the Universe is deterministic, than one is free to do so and as a pleasant benefit of choosing this path, one should feel no stress, obligation, or strife. However, we are also by default capable o creating the illusion of free will through our inability to perfectly model the Universe. If you choose to believe in freedom, then one should optimize over the activities that produce the illusion of free will[^2]. And with all things, one's choice of how much to lean into determinism should be a function of one's Global Aesthetics.[^3]

#### The implications of language, compression.

“From the beginning, the Universe signified the totality of what humankind can expect to know about it. What people call the progress of the human mind and, in any case, the progress of scientific knowledge, could only have been and can only ever be constituted out of processes of correcting and recutting of patterns, regrouping, defining relationships of belonging and discovering new resources, inside a totality which is closed.” - Giorgio Agamben, Taste

Any perception and understanding of the Universe necessarily requires compression, and language is the tool that humans use to achieve compression. Compression distorts the true Reality of the Universe, languages form axioms, and only within the axioms of a given language may statements be judged as True or False. Now with those heavy statements out of the way, one can discuss the effects language and compression[^4]. Language is by far the most dominant feature of human existence, and with it carries many implications: 

Due to compression, humans cannot know objective truths. One implication of this is that humans can only hope to achieve slightly better approximations of Reality over time. Scientific advancement may produce more accurate languages for describing the Universe and its constituent parts, but they will always remain inaccurate to some degree. In this sense, there is no progress, only more "coherent" patterning. 

With the dismantling of objective truths also occurs the dismantling of any hierarchies, and the destruction of such hierarchies has rather radical implications for human comportment towards the philosophical and ethical. With the destruction of hierarchy, any statement of aesthetic superiority is rendered unfounded[^5]. Without a metaphysically sound basis for superiority, one also loses any justification for imposing a normative belief structure upon anyone else. This informs a libertarian or laissez-faire system of political and ethical beliefs by which the will of one should not be imparted upon another[^6]. Put directly, thou shalt not judge nor will to power. This is not to say that you should have no set of beliefs or that you should avoid sharing your tastes and preferences. To the contrary, you should have a rigorous set of beliefs and tastes that is a thoughtful reflection of your Global Aesthetics. Just be aware that this is all it is, a reflection of some environmental, social, cultural matrix in which you were arbitrarily inculcated and that to favor your belief set or forcefully impose it upon another be metaphysically unfounded.

Given that language will necessary fail us, one should also tune their comportent to self accordingly. In dealing with the shortcomings of language, one will not be able to accurately capture their own internal states (feelings, etc) let alone share them with others. Act, but do not speak. State your preferences, but do not explain them. The disappointed man speaks. Through acting in accordance with one's Global Aesthetics your true internal states reveal themselves. 

And yes, this entire section (and post for that matter) is self-referentially ironic[^7].

#### Words in equilibrium.

“We could not reach the final object of knowledge without the dissolution of knowledge, which aims to reduce its object to the condition of subordinated and managed things. The ultimate problem of knowledge is the same as that of consumption. No one can both know and not be destroyed; no one can both consume wealth and increase it.” - Georges Bataille

The set of takeaways posited above paint a rather dim picture of human faculties and our ability to state meaningful things about the Universe. Humans cannot know objective truths, language is necessarily inaccurate, and hierarchies of belief and action are not founded. Things get even worse when you introduce the Void, the inherent ability of humans to iteratively negate any Truth until the set of all possible Truths has been destroyed[^8]. Putting together the flaws of language with the ability to negate any conclusion, one cannot help but arrive at an even darker conclusion about the relationship of humans to knowledge. 

In the equilibrium, all knowledge goes to zero.
In the equilibrium, all wisdom goes to zero.
In the equilibrium, all words go to zero.[^9]

This harsh Reality is not an excuse to do nothing, but rather a token to call on as one performs actions in the Universe. It should not be a disappointing fact of life, but rather a liberating one. In a paradoxical manner, the understanding that knowledge goes to zero liberates one from the burden of knowledge. Bataille accurately posited that one cannot both know and not be destroyed. The solution to this paradox is to destroy knowledge. Then one may both Know and not be destroyed. In this sense, knowledge is a local maxima. One must undergo the painful process of acquiring knowledge in order to arrive at a place where it may be destroyed. One then continues with only a souvenir (token) of their past journey, the Knowledge that knowledge goes to zero.

"In a strange and beautiful valley, a mountain looming over the horizon beckons. Answer its call, ascend the peak, and gaze down into the valley from Olympian heights. From hence, return to the valley and roam, all experiences now imbued with celestial clarity."

- Knowledge is adversarial. Throw away the ladder (quote Wittgenstein) here.


#### Life is a single player game.
- It’s all about people and their singly player stories that shape the world. How to comport oneself given this.
- Given that we are perceptive agents modeling signals from the Universe via language, we truly play a first player game. The implication of this is that within bounds, we can render whatever reality we want. “Life is a single-player game. It is all going on in your head. Given this, shape reality into the reality that you desire.”

#### On the implicatios of self not being consistent.
- Given that the self is not consistent (different) every day, how should you change your comportment towards the world?

#### On Taste, Aesthetics, Beauty, and Passing Judgment
- Given the statement above about no aesthetic being better than any other, how is this reconciled with the great works of art that have transcended culture and time (Boticelli, Beatles, Ludwig van Beethoven), simple, within the forces that give rise to our Global Aesthetics (nature + nature, which is beyond the scope of this post), there are some common threads which are "artistically exploitable". These threads however are particular to human beings and the environment we are raised in (the Earth) and are ultimately arbitrary.
- Aesthetics as knowledge of the excessive signifier (of the beautiful, that which can’t be compressed in language)
- Beauty must save truth and truth must save beauty. In this double salvation, knowledge is realized.
- The invisibility of the evidence (truth) and the evidence of the invisible (beauty).
- The goal of life is to achieve the beautiful, achieve global aesthetics (difference between vectors of 0)
    - because life is a single player game, this is all that matters
    - In the Foucoult sense, our GA are a function of epistemology
- GA is too large to model. GA can only be approached via intuition. Beauty / purpose is GA. Intuition is the only approach to beauty/life/aesthetics. -> Don’t talk about art. 
Should one stress? (Also a statement on comparison between humans)
On passing judgment:
- there can be a hierarchy within the GA of an individual, and one should stake / stress in a way that is commensurate with their hierarchy, their tastes
- But one should not pass judgment on the objectives/stress of others because there is no Universal hierarchy of global aesthetics 

- Beauty is emergently complex systems. Human language, music, art, architecture, society.







[^1]: This being a result of the fact that philosophy generally starts uses natural language and broadly defined concepts to get its point across (as opposed to using a language such as mathematics which is tightly scoped to the domain of concepts where you can prove all the statements that you make).

[^2]: Somewhat ironically, this equates to not modeling the world very well. To explicate this with a faulty anecdote, if you want to believe that anything is possible, simply do not model the constraints of the world.

[^3]: And any belief set somewhere between the extremes of determinism and maximal free will is also permitted, and perhaps recommended. 

[^4]: For a more comprehensive review of these sentences, one can consult the many great minds who have dedicated their careers and lives to the conundrum of language. To name just a few, see the work of Wittgenstein, de Saussure, Russell, Gödel, Lévi-Strauss, and Derrida.

[^5]: If fully internalized this statement has truly radical implications and is a severe indictment of the history of humanity, but I will leave it to the reader to parse that out.

[^6]: By libertarian and laissez-faire I mean to use these signifiers in their pure and undiluted form, not their form that has been soaked in years of competing interests. The reader is left to fill in exactly what this political and ethical belief system should look like.

[^7]: Using language to make fun of language, in case it was not clear, because it was written in language.

[^8]: The Void is a concept that is phenomenologically intuitive but axiomatically difficult to define and prove. A full explanation and proof for the Void may be found in the Map.

[^9]: The equilibrium in this case the Void, the state of play after all possibilities have been iterated through. It is at this equilibrium that the value of all knowledge, wisdom, and words reveals itself to be zero.
