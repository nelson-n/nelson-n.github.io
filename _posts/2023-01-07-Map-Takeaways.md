### Foreward - The Universal and the Human

This piece takes the framework of [*A Map of the Universe*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4077540) (Berger & Rayl 2022) and distills the findings from that paper into a set of principal takeaways. The goal of this exercise is twofold. 1) Create a list of fundamental findings that may be efficiently referenced. 2) Provide a set of insights that are grounded in a rigorous metaphysical framework.

Why engage in such a *vain* pursuit?[^1] For one, philosophy and metaphysics is *naturally* complicated and often results in the running of intellectual circles.[^1] While this is one of the problems that we attempt to address in *A Map of the Universe*, the constraints of human compute and memory often result in one having to tediously re-examine all accumulated knowledge and priors when attempting to address any problem with a philosophical bent to it. By compressing a set of findings to a level that may be readily accessed, this post serves a way to remain intellectually consistent without having to repeat past work. Second, for all that philosophy and metaphysics offers, it rarely informs how one should act. 

When reasoning about philosophy and metaphysics one often finds themselves nevigating between two disparate modalities, the Universal and the human, each with their own geography and rules of engagement. While these two modalities are inherently linked via the Universe generating signals for humans to perceive, it is difficult to bridge between these two foreign territories.

The Universal appears to us as a vast and ordered land, characterized by a set of clear and rigorous laws. However, due to the limitations of the human we can only reason about the rough boundaries of these laws, the principal components of its form. Meanwhile, the territory of the human is best characterized as a disorienting sensory overload of words, emotions, perceived phenomena, and competing interests. It is a territory colored by the totality of human history, and any clarity is a fleeting mirage in the face of language, morality, community, politics, and the detritus of evolution. This piece attempt to draw a clearer connection between the Universal and the human.

In a philosophically consistent world, all actions would be motivated by a rigorous philosophy that is informed by Universal truths. Where possible, this piece attempts to draw a line between findings in the *Map* and implementable heuristics. 

In short, this is a compression exercise. Just as all of human existence is a compression exercise.[^1] 

This piece does not make any arguments, does not try to prove itself, and does not reference anything other than the *Map*. I do not hope to convince anyone of anything, I merely wish to think through the implications of what has already been posited in the *Map* and clarify things for myself and those who have the same insights as me. For rigorous proofs of any of the bold statements made below, one may refer to the full text of *A Map of the Universe*. If it is not immediately obvious where these foundational statements are placed, one may consider the usage the word "necessarily" to be a signal for a bold statement that will be a fundamental to the forthcoming postulation.

The principal ideas dicussed are as follows:

* The Universe is necessarily meaningless. "Meaning" is human specific and should be pursued in accordance with one's Global Aesthetics.
* The Universe is deterministic but humans have the ability to perceive it as non-deterministic. One is free to comport themselves towards this Reality as they wish.
* We cannot know objective truths, in light of this one should not judge, pass objective judgment, nor impart one's will upon another.
* Language fails us. Act, do not speak.
* Intelligence = Models = Compression. That which compresses the best is most intelligent.
* In the equilibrium, knowledge, wisdom, and words go to zero.


### What is the meaning of life? Wrong question.

At the highest level (Reality), there is no meaning of life, just the Universe. As an observer of the Universe, one cannot cannot "understand" (perceive) the Universe without necessarily compressing it via language. Language introduces inaccuracies and with it goes any hope of knowing the meaning of life or the Universe. We necessarily cannot know the meaning of life, for the meaning is the totality which we cannot contain. On a human level, the meaning of life is simply a function of the Global Aesthetics (the preferred perceptive states) chosen by a given human and is necessarily different for each person. With this in mind, one should think very hard about their Global Aesthetics and pursue that which is meaningful with respect to their Global Aesthetics. 

### Comportment toward Determinism

"What's happened, happened, which is an expression of faith in the mechanics of the Universe."

The Universe is discrete and finite, thus it is necessarily deterministic. Given this Reality, how should a human comport themselves towards this determinism? As is commonly the case with metaphysics, theory can only take us so far. Following the pattern of many of the takeaways in this piece, there are a set of higher level Truths about the Universe such as the fact that it is deterministic, but within the domain space defined by these Truths humans are left with no guidance other than to do as we see fit. One may choose to internalize that the Universe is deterministic and by logical extension enjoy the benefits of feeling no stress, obligation, or strife. However, we are also by default capable of creating the illusion of free will through our inability to perfectly model the Universe. If one chooses to believe in freedom, then one should optimize over the activities that produce the illusion of free will and enjoy the feelings of freedom and empowerment that the illusion of free will offers[^2]. And with all things, one's choice of how much to lean into determinism should be a function of Global Aesthetics.[^3]

### The Implications of Language and Compression.

“From the beginning, the Universe signified the totality of what humankind can expect to know about it. What people call the progress of the human mind and, in any case, the progress of scientific knowledge, could only have been and can only ever be constituted out of processes of correcting and recutting of patterns, regrouping, defining relationships of belonging and discovering new resources, inside a totality which is closed.” - Giorgio Agamben, Taste

Perception of the Universe necessarily requires compression, and language is the tool that humans use to achieve compression. Compression distorts the true Reality of the Universe, languages form axioms, and only within the axioms of a given language may statements be judged as True or False. Now with those heavy statements out of the way, one can discuss the laundry list of implication that they have on human existence[^4]. 

To begin, due to compression humans cannot know objective truths. One implication of this is that humans can only hope to achieve slightly better approximations of Reality over time. Scientific advancement may produce more accurate languages for describing the Universe and its constituent parts, but they will always remain inaccurate to some degree. In this sense there is no progress, only more "coherent" patterning.[^5] Science is the religion of the present.
- Advancements in knowledge may be considered beautiful in that they represent a more accurate model of the patterns in the Universe that we perceive, but beyond that its only value is aesthetic (not to discount aesthetic value).

With the dismantling of objective truths also occurs the dismantling of hierarchies, and the destruction of such hierarchies has radical implications for human comportment towards the philosophical and ethical. To begin, any statement of aesthetic superiority is rendered unfounded[^5]. Without claims the aesthetic superiority, one also loses any justification for imposing a normative belief structure upon anyone else. This informs a libertarian or laissez-faire system of political and ethical beliefs by which one's will should not be imparted upon another[^6].  This is not to say that you should have no set of beliefs or avoid sharing tastes and preferences. To the contrary, you should have a rigorous set of beliefs and tastes that is a thoughtful reflection of your Global Aesthetics. Just be aware that this is all it is, a reflection of some environmental, social, cultural matrix in which you were arbitrarily inculcated and that to favor one belief set or forcefully impose it upon another would be metaphysically unfounded.

Given that language will necessary fail us, one should also tune their comportent to self accordingly. In dealing with the shortcomings of language, one will not be able to accurately capture their own internal states (feelings, etc) let alone share them with others. Act, but do not speak. State your preferences, but do not explain them. The disappointed man speaks. Through acting in accordance with one's Global Aesthetics your true internal states reveal themselves. 

And yes, this entire section (and post for that matter) is self-referentially ironic[^7].

### Intelligence = Modeling = Compression

Intelligence is the ability to model the form of the substrate (Universe), and compression is the means by which modeling occurs. By logical extension, intelligence is the ability to compress.

- It's all about modeling. What are the implications of this?
    - Everything from human vision to MNIST neural net to ChatGPT to y = ax + b
    is just a model specified in a given language to explain a substrate phenomenon
    and they all involve converting an input to a compressed and understandable output.

* Map Takeaway - Intelligence is compression.
- Universe is an automata, each stage of intelligence is some form of compression of that massive number of parameters into a compressed form that a compute object (our brain) can operate on.
- That which compresses the most is the most intelligent.
- Thus… AI wins.
- Intelligence = ability to model, models = compression.
- Intelligence = model = compression. 







### Words in Equilibrium

paroles et paroles et paroles et paroles et paroles et paroles

“We could not reach the final object of knowledge without the dissolution of knowledge, which aims to reduce its object to the condition of subordinated and managed things. The ultimate problem of knowledge is the same as that of consumption. No one can both know and not be destroyed; no one can both consume wealth and increase it.” - Georges Bataille

The set of takeaways posited above paint a rather dim picture of human faculties and our ability to state meaningful things about the Universe. Humans cannot know objective truths, language is necessarily inaccurate, and hierarchies of belief and action are not founded. Things get even worse when you introduce the Void, the inherent ability of humans to iteratively negate any Truth until the set of all possible Truths has been destroyed[^8]. Putting together the flaws of language with the ability to negate any conclusion, one cannot help but arrive at an even darker conclusion about the relationship of humans to knowledge. 

In the equilibrium, all words go to zero.[^9]
In the equilibrium, all wisdom goes to zero.
In the equilibrium, all knowledge goes to zero.

This harsh Reality is not an excuse to do nothing, but rather a token to call on as one performs actions in the Universe. It should not be a disappointing fact of life, but rather a liberating one. In a paradoxical manner, the understanding that knowledge goes to zero liberates one from the burden of knowledge. Bataille accurately posited that one cannot both know and not be destroyed. The solution to this paradox is to destroy knowledge. Then one may both Know and not be destroyed. In this sense, knowledge is a local maxima. One must undergo the painful process of acquiring knowledge in order to arrive at a place where it may be destroyed. One may then continues with only a souvenir (token) of their past journey, the Knowledge that knowledge goes to zero.

"In a strange and beautiful valley, a mountain looming over the horizon beckons. Answer its call, ascend the peak, and gaze down into the valley from Olympian heights. From hence, return to the valley and roam, all experiences now imbued with celestial clarity."

- Knowledge is adversarial. Throw away the ladder (quote Wittgenstein) here.


### Life as a Single Player Game
- It’s all about people and their singly player stories that shape the world. How to comport oneself given this.
- Given that we are perceptive agents modeling signals from the Universe via language, we truly play a first player game. The implication of this is that within bounds, we can render whatever reality we want. “Life is a single-player game. It is all going on in your head. Given this, shape reality into the reality that you desire.”

The universe exists within 6 inches of the skull.

While we are in practice constrained in how we model aspects of Reality such as the physical environment due to [genetics, the lack of plasticity of the brain/human compute structure (though in a theoretical sense we could model it any way we wanted, i.e. look at schizophrenics)]. Setting aside the edge case of modifying how we perceive that which is exterior, we have a large amount of autonomy over how we internally comport ourselves towards the exterior signals that we receive. 

We are of course subject to nature, nuture, chemical reactions, seratonin, et cetera, but from the first-principles metaphysics perspective the edge finding is that we can shape perceived Reality into whatever we like. 

There is no normative advice to give about how it should be shaped, but that it should be shaped in accordance with GA and the full understanding that we have control over it.




### Implications of an Inconsistent Self
- Given that the self is not consistent (different) every day, how should you change your comportment towards the world?

- Only pursue the activities that cotify self to the degree that it aids in the realization of your Global Aesthetics.
- Know that you will have to rebuild yourself every day.



### On Taste, Aesthetics, Beauty, and Judgment

- The majority of the takeaways thus far have been of the form: this is the way things are in Reality, but Reality does not prescribe a normative reccomendation, so with this Reality in mind pursue your Global Aesthetics. While the following will not attempt to prescribe aesthetics, it studies where aesthetics come from and offers a way to think about aesthetics.

- Given the statement above about no aesthetic being better than any other, how is this reconciled with the great works of art that have transcended culture and time (Boticelli, Beatles, Ludwig van Beethoven), simple, within the forces that give rise to our Global Aesthetics (nature + nature, which is beyond the scope of this post), there are some common threads which are "artistically exploitable". These threads however are particular to human beings and the environment we are raised in (the Earth) and are ultimately arbitrary.
- Aesthetics as knowledge of the excessive signifier (of the beautiful, that which can’t be compressed in language)
- Beauty must save truth and truth must save beauty. In this double salvation, knowledge is realized.
- The invisibility of the evidence (truth) and the evidence of the invisible (beauty).
- The goal of life is to achieve the beautiful, achieve global aesthetics (difference between vectors of 0)
    - because life is a single player game, this is all that matters
    - In the Foucoult sense, our GA are a function of epistemology
- GA is too large to model. GA can only be approached via intuition. Beauty / purpose is GA. Intuition is the only approach to beauty/life/aesthetics. -> Don’t talk about art. 
Should one stress? (Also a statement on comparison between humans)
On passing judgment:
- there can be a hierarchy within the GA of an individual, and one should stake / stress in a way that is commensurate with their hierarchy, their tastes
- But one should not pass judgment on the objectives/stress of others because there is no Universal hierarchy of global aesthetics 

- Given that knowledge and words go to 0, value knowledge for its aesthetic beauty. Clarity to optimize over food, music, views, etc, this is all that matters when words go to 0. There is no point in understanding, just feel. 

- Beauty is emergently complex systems. Human language, music, art, architecture, society.

### How to act in a metaphysically silent Universe?

- Sam's Aristotelian idea of doing the best version of yourself as the only metaphysically logical goal.

"You call out to the Universe for answers and receive only silence."

Principal idea: doggedly pursue your GA.

How should one act, how should one inform decisions in the human-centric aspects of life where metaphysics gives us no guide. It does not tell us how to act, apart from in accordance with our Global Aesthetics. While this is sufficiently vague, it provides a whole modus operandi, set of morals, drive, and decision heuristics once it is completely filled with one's Global Aesthetics. Metaphysics cannot tell us how to set our Global Aesthetics, but it does tell us to doggedly pursue it and to not preoccupy ourselves with the actions of others. This is the metaphysical call, to doggedly pursue our Global Aesthestics, the person that we want to be and the perceptive states that we want to experience.
- Metaphysics does not inform us what to pursue, just TO pursue.
- This is Heideggar's Dasein... ask Sam for help on this.
- Do an addendum on how Global Aesthetics are set, whether you should think hard about setting them. GA is a function of nature + nurture and is of course deterministic in reality. Given this, should you think hard about setting your GA? Need to find a way to justify this.
- Tie this section into the section on taste, beauty and aesthetics. Talk about how you should be doggedly pursuing this beauty (the Greek God body, the optimal fashion, etc).

- Pursuit of GA is the task the Universe assigns us, so the full instantiating of life is pursuing GA to the extreme. Chasing the Platonic with maximum rigor. 

- This is also a metaphysically justified call to always be moving forward, always pursuing the "you" at t+1. (Show drawing here of perceptive state vectors closing).







[^1]: Maps are tools of compression that contain knowledge about the territory. This piece is simply a map^2, a map of a map.

[^1]: For the search for metaphysical truths is performed both in *vain* and in *vanity*.

[^1]: This being a result of the fact that philosophy generally starts uses natural language and broadly defined concepts to get its point across (as opposed to using a language such as mathematics which is tightly scoped to the domain of concepts where you can prove all the statements that you make).

[^2]: Somewhat ironically, this equates to not modeling the world very well. To explicate this with a faulty anecdote, if you want to believe that anything is possible, simply do not model the constraints of the world.

[^3]: And any belief set somewhere between the extremes of determinism and maximal free will is also permitted, and perhaps recommended. 

[^4]: For a more comprehensive review of these sentences, one can consult the many great minds who have dedicated their careers and lives to the conundrum of language. To name just a few, see the work of Wittgenstein, de Saussure, Russell, Gödel, Lévi-Strauss, and Derrida.

[^5] Which is not to claim that there is no value to pursuit of more coherent patterning.

[^5]: If fully internalized this statement has truly radical implications and is a severe indictment of the history of humanity, but I will leave it to the reader to parse that out.

[^6]: By libertarian and laissez-faire I mean to use these signifiers in their pure and undiluted form, not their form that has been soaked in years of competing interests. The reader is left to fill in exactly what this political and ethical belief system should look like.

[^7]: Using language to make fun of language, in case it was not clear, because it was written in language.

[^8]: The Void is a concept that is phenomenologically intuitive but axiomatically difficult to define and prove. A full explanation and proof for the Void may be found in the Map.

[^9]: The equilibrium in this case the Void, the state of play after all possibilities have been iterated through. It is at this equilibrium that the value of all knowledge, wisdom, and words reveals itself to be zero.
