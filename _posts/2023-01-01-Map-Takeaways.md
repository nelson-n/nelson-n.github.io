So much chaos, so much noise.

Complexity = Beauty
-  Talk about Kolmogorov complexity

Intelligence = Compression

To be a great human is to live in superposition between the human and the Universal. A Kierkegaardian leap that does not leave the ground. 
* The superposition between being a ruthless competitor and a respectful sportsman. You want to utterly annhilate your oppenent, but without them there is no dance.
* The paradox between the underlying Reality of the Universe and how you would like to participate in the Universe.

Make a compelling argument for why you have to be optimistic and overwhelmingly positive, and love the Universe.
- Make an argument for why nihilism and discontentment have no residual.

* Update footnote numbers.
* "A border marks an inside and an outside." - Jean Luc Nancy
    - Connection to the map and the territory as an analogy.
    - Weave the idea of map, territory, edge cases (borders) throughout the piece.
    - "We return again to the border of the human territory."

    What is love? How does it fit into the map?
- “Love unveils finitude” 98
- Love = understanding that you aren’t the Universe?


## Foreward - The Universal and the Human

*"A border marks an inside and an outside."* - Jean Luc Nancy

The goal of this piece is simple, identify a set of metaphysically consistent Truths that inform how humans are to act in the Universe. While this appears a noble pursuit, any student of metaphysics will quickly sense the tension and perhaps impossibility of such a task. For all that metaphysics offers, it generally remains silent on the subject of human behavior. With this acknowledgment of likely failure in mind, we set out nonetheless. 

When reasoning about metaphysics and philosophy one often finds themselves nevigating between two disparate modalities, the Universal and the human. While these two modalities are inherently linked, the *"hard"* problem of perception makes it nigh impossible to bridge between these foreign territories.[^1] The Universal appears as a precise and ordered territory, governed by a minimal set of clear and rigorous laws. A vast and empty space that, like a blank canvas, has a rough form and dimension that we can make out, but whose content is empty and indiscernable to us. In contrast, the human appears as a messy tapestry of chaos, conflict, color, and complication. The territory of the human is filled with words, wisdom, emotion, perceived phenomenon, and incompleteness. It is a space colored by the totality of human history, and any clarity or order is a fleeting mirage in the face of language, morality, community, politics, and the detritus of evolution.[^2] An excess of energy where uncertainly increases linearly with examination, and any search for objective truths is met with confusion and disappointment. 

The territory of the human fits somewhere inside the vast expanse of the Universal, and this piece focuses its attention on the border between these two foreign lands, the place where the rigor and clarity of the Universal meets the chaos and noise of the human. It is at this boundary where we may attempt to cut through the confusion and circuity of the human towards a clarity that we can cite as *Universally* consistent, a clarity that we may carry with us through the disorienting territory of the human. We cannot map nor know the territory of the Universal, but by mapping the border between the Universal and the human we may identify the total domain space that is the human. While this does not allow us to make statements about where in that domain space we should fall, we may use it to make metaphysically correct statements about the properties of the human domain and inform where in the domain space we place ourselves. Additionally, this map leaves us with a tool for cutting the noise and chaos of the human down to a minimal set of propositions in which we may believe. A map of what is certain. The rest is noise.

This piece builds upon the framework of [*A Map of the Universe*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4077540) (Berger & Rayl 2022), taking the findings of that paper as a guide for metaphysical correctness. This piece does not make any arguments, does not try to prove itself, and does not reference anything other than the *Map*. I do not hope to convince anyone of anything, I merely wish to think through the implications of what has already been posited in the *Map* and clarify things for myself and those who have the same insights as me. For rigorous proofs of any of the statements made below, one may refer to the full text of *A Map of the Universe*. 

With that, we set off to map the boundary between the human and the Universal.

## On the Meaning of the Universe

* Draw domain space of the human and the Universal, show what happens when we approach the limit of the Universal.

The human pursuit is ultimately a tragic one as we will never find inherent meaning.

"The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience. A process that cannot be understood by stopping it. We must move with the flow of the process."


At the Universal level (Reality), there is no meaning, only the Universe. As an observer of the Universe, one cannot "understand" (perceive) the Universe without necessarily compressing it via language. Language introduces inaccuracies and negates any chance of knowing the meaning of the Universe. We necessarily cannot know the meaning of Universe, for the meaning is the totality which we cannot contain. The negation of our ability to ever find inherent meaning in the Universe has grand implications. It is first and foremost an acceptance of the futility of the human project. We will never be able to accomplish that which our existence demands from us: understand the Universe. And no matter the degree of technological or intellectual advance, the pursuit of inherent meaning will be a chase towards an unattainable limit. From theory we are able to know that our ability to know the Universal will decrease asymptotically as we approach the limit of the Universal. Given this boundary condition we may know that any claims of inherent meaning are false and any pursuit of inherent meaning will necessarily fail. Usually theory can take us only so far, but in this case it takes to the end and allows us to set a firm limit. So where does this leave us? The necessary boundary between the human and the Universal leaves us with the space of the human in which to scrap for meaning. On a human level, meaning is simply a function of the Global Aesthetics (preferred perceptive states) chosen by a given human and is necessarily different for each person. With this in mind, one should think very hard about their Global Aesthetics and pursue that which is meaningful with respect to their Global Aesthetics. Equally, one should understand that this meaning is not inherent nor Universal, and thus should not lose sleep wondering if they are correct nor take offence at competing views of meaning. 

You may find pockets of meaning and purpose in the territory of the human, but remember these pockets of meaning are nothing more than a constructed game, and that this game that you play is not moving towards anything absolute. And that the collective force or humanity, or more broadly intelligence, wanders aimlessly with respect to the ultimate goal of attaining inherent meaning. This should not change how you act day to day, but it should color how you comport yourselves towards this action.

## Comportment Towards Determinism

"What's happened, happened, which is an expression of faith in the mechanics of the Universe."

The Universe is discrete and finite, thus it is necessarily deterministic. Given that the domain of the human is situated within the domain of the Universal, it is also necessarily deterministic. Having established this Reality, how should a human comport themselves towards determinism? As is commonly the case with metaphysics, theory can only take us so far. Following the pattern of many of the takeaways in this piece, there are a set of higher level Truths about the Universe such as its deterministic nature, but within the domain space defined by these Truths humans are left with no guidance other than to act as we see fit. At the extreme, one may choose to internalize that the Universe is deterministic and by logical extension enjoy the benefits of feeling no stress or strife. However, we are by default capable of creating the illusion of free will through our inability to perfectly model the Universe. If one chooses to believe in free will, then one should optimize over the activities that produce the illusion of free will and experience the freedom and empowerment that the illusion of free will offers[^2]. And with all things, one's choice of how much to lean into determinism or the illusion of free will should be a function of their Global Aesthetics.[^3] Many will end up somewhere between these two extremes, battling between our ability to generate illusions of free will and the rational mind telling us that our lives must surely be deterministic. This internal discontinuity highlights an often present conflict between the Universal and the human. One may know and believe that the Universe is deterministic, yet in the realm of the human it is nigh impossible to fully internalize this fact into our thought and action as it is incommensurate with our biological disposition. Epochs of evolution has wired us with truths that are not metaphysically correct, causing us to forget or turn away from Truths we may deduce from precise, logical consideration of the Universe. In examining the boundary between the human and the Universal, we often find that the laws of the Universal clash with what we have inherited from the territory of the human. The degree to which we rebel against the human in pursuit of clarity is left to the user, though I imagine most readers of this piece will find it a battle worth fighting.

## The Implications of Language and Compression

“From the beginning, the Universe signified the totality of what humankind can expect to know about it. What people call the progress of the human mind and, in any case, the progress of scientific knowledge, could only have been and can only ever be constituted out of processes of correcting and recutting of patterns, regrouping, defining relationships of belonging and discovering new resources, inside a totality which is closed.” - Giorgio Agamben, *Taste*

Perception of the Universe necessarily requires compression, and language is the tool that humans use to achieve compression. Compression distorts the true Reality of the Universe, languages form axioms, and only within the axioms of a given language may statements be judged as True or False. Having established these weighty statements, one may discuss the implications of language on human existence.

Language is compression, and as a result of compression humans cannot know objective truths. One implication of this is that humans can only hope to achieve slightly "better" (or perhaps just different) approximations of Reality over time. Scientific advancement may produce more accurate languages for describing the Universe and its constituent parts, but these languages will always remain inaccurate to some degree. In this sense there is no progress, only more "coherent" patterning, and knowledge is an aesthetic judgment[^5]. Science is the religion of the present, and in the future it will be supplanted by another language. Advancements in knowledge are beautiful in that they represent novel, more accurate models of the patterns that the Universe produces, however, these advancements in knowledge do not strive towards a finality and their value is merely aesthetic. An elegant, but inaccurate way to pattern the Universe. Despite knowledge being subordinated to the realm of aesthetics, it remains a worthy pursuit as at the end of the day aesthetics is all that we have.

The omnipresence of language and compression in the territory of the human also negates the possibility of objective truths. With this topples any hierarchies, and the destruction of such hierarchies has radical implications for human comportment towards the philosophical and ethical. To begin, any statement of aesthetic superiority is rendered unfounded[^5]. Without claim to aesthetic superiority, any justification for imposing a normative belief structure upon anyone else is lost. If we are to remain metaphysically consistent, this informs a "libertas" system of political and ethical beliefs by which one's will should not be imparted upon another[^6]. This is not to say that one should abstain from all normative beliefs and preferences. To the contrary, one is called to craft a rigorous set of beliefs and tastes that is a thoughtful reflection of one's Global Aesthetics. However, remain aware that this is all it is, a reflection of some environmental, social, cultural matrix in which one is arbitrarily inculcated, and to assert an aesthetic hierarchy and impose this hierarchy upon another would be metaphysically unfounded.

However, simply because it is unfounded does not mean that we do not go about doing it. An assertion of aesthetic hierarchy is necessary to action in the world. Consider any organizational structure, in any process of action (setting a target, working towards that target, often with multiple individuals), there is implictly and necessarily a hierarchy of ideas and aesthetics. The actions we take upon the world and aesthetic structures we ascribe to in order to do so are a reflection of our own Global Aesthetics, and in any action we assert these aesthetics upon the world. This is the boundary where the Universal meets the human, and once again they are in conflict. 


This is one of the elegant areas where we can draw a direct connection between metaphysical Truth and how we should act in the the world.


There has to be more implications of language??



Given that language will necessary fail us, one should also tune their comportent to self accordingly. In dealing with the shortcomings of language, one will not be able to accurately capture their own internal states (feelings) let alone share them with others. Act, but do not speak. State your preferences, but do not explain them. The disappointed man speaks. Through acting in accordance with one's Global Aesthetics your true internal states reveal themselves. 

And yes, this entire section (and piece for that matter) is self-referentially ironic[^7].



## Words in Equilibrium

“We could not reach the final object of knowledge without the dissolution of knowledge, which aims to reduce its object to the condition of subordinated and managed things. The ultimate problem of knowledge is the same as that of consumption. No one can both know and not be destroyed; no one can both consume wealth and increase it.” - Georges Bataille

The takeaways posited above paint a rather dim picture of the human and our ability to make meaningful statements about the Universe. Humans cannot know objective truths, language is necessarily inaccurate, and hierarchies of belief and action are not founded. Things get even worse when considering the Void, the inherent ability of humans to iteratively negate any Truth until the set of all possible Truths has been destroyed[^8]. Putting together the flaws of language with the ability to negate any conclusion, one arrives at the following conclusion about the relationship of humans to knowledge. 

In the equilibrium, all words go to zero.[^9]
In the equilibrium, all knowledge goes to zero.

This harsh Reality is not an excuse to do nothing, but rather a token to call on as one performs actions in the Universe. It should not be a disappointing fact of life, but rather a liberating one. In a paradoxical manner, the understanding that knowledge goes to zero liberates one from the burden of knowledge. Bataille accurately posited that one cannot both know and not be destroyed. The solution to this paradox is to destroy knowledge, then one may both know and not be destroyed. In this sense, knowledge is a local maxima. One must undergo the painful process of acquiring knowledge in order to arrive at a place where it may be destroyed. One may then continues with only a token from their past journey, the knowledge that knowledge goes to zero. Knowledge is adversarial. Throw away the ladder (quote Wittgenstein) here. This finding informs two important takeaways about how one should comport themselves to words and knowledge.

Words are not functional objects. Words are aesthetic objects.
Knowledge is not functional, it is merely aesthetic.

It is important that words and knowledge are approached with an understanding of what these objects truly are. They are aesthetic objects, and should ultimately be enjoyed as such. While these objects can take on great meaning in the realm of the human, they should be stripped of all meaning when tarrying in the realm of the Universal. Where one tries to mingle the profound and the banal, the disappointed man speaks.

- Given that knowledge and words go to 0, value knowledge for its aesthetic beauty. Clarity to optimize over food, music, views, etc, this is all that matters when words go to 0. There is no point in understanding, just feel. 



## Intelligence = Modeling = Compression

*Note: Is this at odds with the earlier statement, "Advancements in knowledge may be considered beautiful in that they represent a more accurate model of the patterns that the Universe produces".

Intelligence is the ability to model the patterns produced by the Universe, and compression is the means by which modeling occurs. By logical extension, intelligence is the ability to compress. The takeaway from this is that it is all about modeling. Everything from human vision to conciousness to multiparameter algorithms to y = ax + b are models specified in a given language to compress the patterns generated by the Universe. That which compresses the most is the most intelligent. If one seeks the aesthetic value of intelligence as an aspect of their Global Aesthetics, then they should focus on the set of models that compress the patterns of the Universe the most.


Talk about beauty of that which is most difficult to compress: ocean waves.


## The Universe Individuated

As perceptive agents modeling signals from the Universe via language, reality is entirely a function of our own modeling processes. This raises the question of how one should comport themselves to the boundary case that we can render reality as we wish. In practice we are constrained in how we model aspects of Reality such as our perception of the physical environment due to a lack of complete plasticity in the models we use to perceive the Universe (or put colloquially, biological constraints make it difficult to un-see a brick wall). However, schizophrenia, psychedelic drugs, and other phenomena are evidence that there is nothing innate or pure about the way that the median human perceives reality. Setting aside these edge cases, we still maintain a large amount of autonomy over how we comport ourselves towards the signals that the Universe produces. Phenomenologically, this is something that humans are intimately familiar with. When we feel emotional states of joy or bliss, the world is perceived as lighter, louder, and warmer. When we feel states of malaise, anger, or disquiet, the world take on an altogether darker hue. In these cases it is the not the environment that is in flux, but rather the human observer that is in flux. In this sense, one should think of the environment (the Universe) as static and the internal states and appraisals of the human as what is in flux.

Given this boundary, we are left with some *autonomy* to perceive Reality in a manner that is commensurate with our preferences and global aesthetics. It is thus the duty of the individual to adopt a set of practices that helps to bring their perceived reality in line with their Global Aesthetics. The shape of this practice is left to the individual, but it may take the form of a referent, a reminder, a specific environment, meditation, or any other trigger that alters perception.

* Given that the world is how we perceive it, we must surely be optimists. The Universe is fixed and our perception of it is that which is in flux. Optimism allows us to unRealistically skew this perception in a positive direction. Here we observe the paradox of the Human and the Universal again. We know that Reality is deterministic and that optimism and pessimism are moot emotions who at best take the form of some distribution with $\mu = 0$, yet by adopting optimism the zero sum game of Reality becomes skewed in our favor. The prior through which we view the world become the world, and thus these priors should reflect ones Global Aesthetics.
    * Make a stronger argument in favor of optimism.
    * It does not matter that optimism will have a low level of fit with reality, as long as one remains optimistic in the face of many inevitable defeats (for predicted rates of success ex-ante were unRealistically high), then one has beaten the game (Reality). They have on net mapped Reality (fixed) to a better set of perceptive states.

## Implications of an Inconsistent Self

"Self is the culmination of the Concepts that allow a Perceptive Agent to perceive itself and formalize a distinct set of tastes." - A Map of the Universe

The Self is not a concrete, tangible, or consistent object. It is instead a set of models representing the behavior of an agent, in short a compressed representation of how an agent will model a given environment [footnote: this representation is not limited to an agent's representation of itself, a different representation is contained by those who the agent interacts with, our representation of self is necessary different from how others represent us]. One is a Self to the degree that this representation is maintained in a recognizable form across time, but given computational limits of the brain it is impossible to perfectly maintain this representation as an unchanging state.

A representation of Self at time *t-1* is necessarily different from the representation at time *t* as one forgets what they believe, what they have accomplished, and what they represent. Self is also fungible beyond temporal changes. A Self can be passed between different agents, transcend the death of the embodying agent, and be accessed and represented by a limitless number of agents. The Self is not a sacred object belonging to an individual, and it is not stable over time.

Humans have evolved to maintain a fairly consistent Self because it is commensurate with our biologically ordained objectives of navigating the local environment, maintaining the perceptive ability of the embodying agent, and procreating (one can imagine that social organization, labor, and survival would be quite difficult if we embodied different representations of Self each day). However, one need not look farther than edge cases such as amnesia to touch the boundaries of the human and observe that an unstable representation of Self is commensurate with the laws of the Universe. Although we do not see ourselves in such extreme terms, an unstable representation of Self is exactly the behavior we exhibit. The consistent thread of Self that we experience is a function of our inability to model, and if we could perfectly model the Universe we would realize that our representation of Self is not consistent between different time periods and is indeed no more than a representation.

The ephemeral nature of Self gives us a strong boundary from which we can draw conclusions about the true nature of the human condition. Though these conclusions are upsetting to that which we often hold in the highest regard, the Self, they also liberate us from the demanding need to maintain representation. Striving for a concrete and consistent Self will always result in despair and anguish as the Self is de facto inconsistent. Treating the Self as an ephemeral representation also gives us agency over the Self as one is free to choose the aspects of Self that they identify with.

Despite this relative freedom that the Universe grants us, the ability to maintain a consistent self is an important feature for accomplishing many of the objectives that have been historically favored by human society: achieving long-term goals, maintaining inter-human relationships, and long-term planning based on a set of consistent tastes. To the degree that these objectives are commensurate with ones Global Aesthetics, one should lean into practices and mantras that consistently remind oneself of their constructed Self. The form of these practices is again left to the individual, and may overlap with practices aimed at autonomously altering the way in which you perceive the Universe. And if the practice involves compiling a set of takeaways about the nature of the Universe to remind yourself of a few things, go ahead.

## On Aesthetics, Clarity, and Beauty

The above sections have worked to clearly identify the boundaries of the human realm and have typically taken the form of: this is the way things are in Reality, but Reality does not prescribe normative reccomendations, so with this in mind one should pursue that which is commensurate with their Global Aesthetics. While the following section will not attempt to prescribe a normative Global Aesthetics, it studies where aesthetics come from and offers a way to think about aesthetics.

One may object to the claim that the Universe remains silent on the subject of aesthetics, citing Platonic forms and the existence of works of art, social modes, and beauty that have transcended culture and time. While the persistance of certain aesthetics make it difficult to argue against the possibility of the Platonic, this Platonic may be easily reconciled as a phenomena that exists within the space of the human and is ultimately a function of nature and nurture (footnote: the exact decomposition of which is not to be considered in this post). Within the social, economic, and biological forces that give rise aesthetics, there are a set of common threads foisted upon us by the epistemes of the era, epistemes that have been proven by many to be ultimately arbitrary (cite Fourcoult here). The Universe remains silent on Global Aesthetics, but the history of humanity does not. This again leaves us in an unsatisfactory place, as we are given no guidance on the precise object around which we are to fashion our lives, aesthetics.

Once again, the best we can do is to give a definition of aesthetics and define the boundaries in which we may operate. Aesthetics is the excessive signifier. A set of Parts that cannot be captured by any given language or model without a large degree of slippage, and it is precisely in this slippage that aesthetics may be found. Out of this definition falls important implications. The inability for aesthetics to be captured and compressed means that aesthetics and Global Aesthetics may only be approached via intuition. For the same reason aesthetics cannot be discussed, only shown. Destined for failure is the human who attempts to explain their Global Aesthetics for the only authentic representation of aesthetics comes through action. Do not speak, act. This act is Beauty, in and of itself. Beauty is an aesthetic that is fully pronounced, fully realized. An act that maximizes the excessive signifier with respect to a given aesthetic and actualizes this excessive signifier upon the substrate of Reality. In this sense, Beauty is precisely the act of aligning Reality with a Global Aesthetic. Thus follows that the goal of life is to achieve the beautiful, to strive to achieve one's Global Aesthetics. And given the individuated nature of the Universe, achieving this Beauty is all that matters.

If Beauty is a pursuit, an act of moving in a specific direction, the question remains of what this direction should be. While no normative direction can be prescribed, we can assert that this direction ought to be well-defined. This is Clarity. A well-defined understanding of one's Global Aesthetics, a certainty about the direction in which one should move in the pursuit of Beauty. If Beauty is the only pursuit, then we are better served if this pursuit follows a linear path instead of one which wanders. While advice on how to achieve Clarity is beyond the scope of this work, within the framework developed in this piece we can assert the importance of Clarity and its role in actualizing Beauty.

## Life as a Paradox

Life is a superposition paradox between wanting to fight the perfect story, optimize the perfect life, whilst simultaneously knowing that what you do doesn’t matter, what you care about is arbitrary, and the existence you live is ultimately tragic. It is the paradox between wanting to dominate your opponent and wanting to see your opponent flourish. Kierkegaards ballerina was about commensurating between god and existence. This is in many ways the same. The leap. The superposition of both states. Living in one whilst living in the other simultaneously.

## How to Act in a Metaphysically Silent Universe

"Philosophy is the process of imagining an ideal Universe in the attempt to establish purpose."

Any call to the Universal is met with silence as its meaning is nothing more than that which it is, and that which it is cannot be captured by anything other than the Universe itself. This leaves us in a metaphysically silent Universe in which the only object we have to cling is a set of Global Aesthetics imparted upon us. While our Global Aesthetics appears a shaky lifeboat amid a sweeping sea of silence, it is all that we have to cling to, and in a metaphysically precarious Universe the best that we can do is cling on tightly.

Clinging to and striving towards our Global Aesthetics is how we are to act in a metaphysically silent Universe. This is to craft a lifeboat of Global Aesthetics in which we are stable and certain, and then ride this lifeboat through the hostile environ that it the Universal, an environ where humans were not meant to go. Our Global Aesthetics provides a modus operandi, a set of morals, tastes, objectives, and future states around which we may construct meaning, purpose, and stability. At the end of the day Global Aesthetics is all that we have, and thus we must approach and pursue it with the utmost care and rigor.

One must meditate on their Global Aesthetics in order to achieve Clarity. With Clarity in hand, one may then pursue Beauty, a dogged pursuit of Global Aesthetics. This is the call of the human. Not ordained by the Universe, for the Universe is silent, but the only pursuit that is logically commensurate with the Universe. The Universal does not tell us what to pursue, it only offers pursuit as an alternative to drowning. We cannot know if it is the correct pursuit, only that it is the only pursuit. And it is with this minor hint that we must run. We must doggedly pursue our Global Aesthetics and actualize the perceptive states that we wish to experience. We must doggedly pursue beauty, forming the excessive signifier that keeps us afloat. And while we may easily brush away the Platonic with even a mild level of metaphysical reasoning, the Platonic and its pursuit is all that we are offered and thus it is the ultimate aim. The full instantiation of life is the pursuit of beauty to its extreme, the chasing of the Platonic with maximum rigor. It is not what we do, it is that we do, for that pursuit is the only metaphysically commensurate action that we may impart upon the Universe.

# The Counterfactual is Nothingness

Perception of the Universe is all that there is. The alternative to this is not perceiving all that there is, a state of nothingness. Thus if one finds the states presented bythe Universe preferable to nothingness, than one must live in profound gratitude. Pray often and pray forcefully, for we are lucky that there exists anything at all.

Optimism always.



## Afterword

And as always the following disclaimer applies. Despite sacrificing scope to make strong/defensible claims, and despite appearing to be built on a rigorous metaphysical framework, this work and the statements/findings within are but a rickety ladder that are unverifiable and very well could represent just another set of aesthetic judgments. Despite an intense desire to live by clarity and truth with respect to the metaphysical laws of the Universe, this too is a ladder that must be thrown away. For anyone with the attention or brain to folow along will surely be able to arb away/cast doubt into anything that has been postulated. So we press on, feeling a little better about our action that we did before the map takeaways, but altogether not particularly good about anything at all.
