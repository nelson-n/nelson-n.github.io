Forthcoming blog post about attention (or a lack thereof). Hold tight folks, this one is going to be good.


**To-do**
- Come up with a better name for the post.


Put formally, attention is the act of subsetting a portion of the perceptive state. Casually, ...


It always seems strange to talk about the brain given how little we know about it, but I will resort to the classic analogy with a computer as I think it is the best that we have.uses 


Attention and Compression Theory
1. Attention is that which is scarce.
2. There are fundamental limits to human attainment across domains.
    1. Flops of compute * waking hours * ? (compute this).
3. Issues of limited attention can be overcome via compression.
    1. i.e. compress an idea or complex issue into a news article.
4. Understanding others requires attention, and attention is scarce.
    1. Thus, society highly values highly compressable traits (beauty/visual appearance, job title, school).
5. Reality does not matter, only perception matters and perception is compression.

Addendum on clarity:
Clarity is the ability to know exactly where you are in the abstraction stack at all times. Clarity is also the ability to commit your precious mental cycles to what is important.
- An important component of clarity is being able to focus your scarce attention on what matters (if you are in a beautiful place, you focus on the beauty of the place, not the people).

Why do humans think in terms of a vertical stack representation, layers of abstraction, a hierarchy of layers.
- This is one of the dominant languages that humans use to “understand” the world because of limited attention. 
- Humans can only attend to one layer in the vertical abstraction stack at a time (a limited understanding of one thing), and because of this we need to iteratively traverse a layer of abstraction and forget past layers in order to get to the highest level. 
- Due to limited attention, we frame (pattern, langauge) the world as vertical abstraction stacks in order to understand it. 
- The key is to know at all times where you are in the abstraction stack. 
- Hofstader on the attention stack:

Hofstadter argues that consciousness arises from the interplay of many levels of abstraction and self-reference within the mind. He believes that the mind creates a self-referential structure through the process of "strange loops", in which higher-level concepts reference lower-level concepts and vice versa.

Hofstadter also suggests that consciousness cannot be reduced to simple algorithms or physical processes, and that it emerges from the complex interplay of different levels of abstraction and self-reference within the mind. In this sense, he views consciousness as an emergent property of the mind, rather than a reducible phenomenon.



Addendum: Intuition is the gradient away from despair. 
- Given limited attention, the role of intuition is heightened.
- You cannot model everything out, so intuition becomes the sum of all compressed
models and can guide you away from the despair of introspection and modeling everything fully.

Addendum: The answer is not at the extremes.
Life is a joint optimization problem. We are attracted to the extremes because the extremes are easily compressible and our limited attention draws us to these "simple answers". However, the answer does now lie here (think about why).
