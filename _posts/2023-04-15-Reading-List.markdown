The following is a set of curated reading lists. These reading lists each follow a distinct thread that transcends time, literary style, or theme. The goal of each reading list is to identify books that speak nicely to each other and ultimately offer the reader a robust understanding of a specific topic. Lists should be read in order and will be periodically updated.
