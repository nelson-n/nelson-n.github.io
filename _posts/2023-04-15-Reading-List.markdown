The following is a set of curated reading lists. These reading lists each follow a distinct thread that transcends time, literary style, or theme. The goal of these reading lists is to identify books that speak nicely with each other and will ultimately offer the reading a robust understanding of a specific element of literature and the human experience. Lists should be read in order.

### Great Narrative

Books that do an exceptional job of capturing human existence and its associated follies at a granular level. Readers of this list will walk away with a greater understanding and empathy for everything that occurs within the six inches of the human head.

1. *Madame Bovary*, **Gustave Flaubert**, 1856 &darr; 
2. *Anna Karenina*, **Leo Tolstoy**, 1877 &darr; 
3. *Swann's Way*, **Marcel Proust**, 1913 &darr; 
4. *My Struggle Books 1-7*, **Karl Knausgaard**, 2009 &darr;
5. *American Pastoral*, **Philip Roth**, 1997 

### On Human Nature

A set of works that illuminate the complex dualities of humanity and the nature of good and evil. Readers of this list will learn things about the world, not necessarily nice things.

1. *Paradise Lost*, **John Milton**, 1674 &darr;
2. *On the Genealogy of Morality*, **Friedrich Nietzsche**, 1887 &darr;
3. *Crime and Punishment*, **Fyodor Dostoevsky**, 1866 &darr; 
4. *Heart of Darkness*, **Joseph Conrad**, 1899 &darr;
5. *The Brothers Karamazov*, **Fyodor Dostoevsky**, 1880

### Misanthropic Malaise 

A list of novels tracing the maladies of our age throughout history: decadence, alienation, nihilism, malaise. Readers of this list will walk away with a greater understanding of the darker sides of modernity and how we arrived here. **Warning** reading these books may cause irreparable damage.

1. *The Stranger*, **Albert Camus**, 1942 &darr;
2. *A Hero of Our Time*, **Mikhail Lermontov**, 1840 &darr;
3. *Against Nature*, **Joris-Karl Huysmans**, 1884 &darr;
4. *Submission*, **Michel Houellebecq**, 2015 &darr;
5. *The Map and the Territory*, **Michel Houellebecq**, 2010 

### The Epics

A set of works that transcend the description of story, book, or novel to achieve the status of an epic. Readers of this list will walk away understanding that within the totality of society, individuals exist within the superposition of insignificance and absolute importance. 

1. *The Iliad*, **Homer**, 750BC &darr;
2. *The Odyssey*, **Homer**, 700BC &darr;
3. *The Aeneid*, **Virgil**, 29BC &darr;
4. *War and Peace*, **Leo Tolstoy**, 1867
